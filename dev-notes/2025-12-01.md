## Premium UI/UX Upgrade

Comprehensive overhaul of the frontend UI/UX to create a polished, professional experience.

### Design System (globals.css)

Created a complete design system with:

```css
/* Premium color palette with CSS variables */
--primary-50 through --primary-900  /* Blue gradient scale */
--accent-gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);

/* Shadow system */
--shadow-sm through --shadow-2xl
--shadow-glow: 0 0 20px rgb(59 130 246 / 0.3);

/* Smooth transitions */
--transition-fast: 150ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
--transition-normal: 200ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
--transition-bounce: 500ms cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55);
```

#### Custom Animations Added

| Animation | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `fadeIn` / `fadeInUp` / `fadeInDown` | Element entrance |
| `slideInRight` | Drawer entrance |
| `scaleIn` | Modal/popup appearance |
| `shimmer` | Loading skeleton effect |
| `pulse-glow` | Attention indicator |
| `float` | Subtle movement |
| `typing-cursor` | Chat streaming indicator |

#### Global Button Cursor Fix

```css
/* All interactive elements now have proper cursor */
button,
[role="button"],
input[type="submit"],
input[type="button"],
input[type="reset"],
.cursor-pointer {
  cursor: pointer;
}

button:disabled,
[role="button"]:disabled,
input:disabled {
  cursor: not-allowed;
}
```

#### Utility Classes Added

```css
.glass          /* Glass morphism: blur + translucency */
.glass-dark     /* Dark glass morphism */
.gradient-text  /* Gradient text effect */
.btn-primary    /* Premium button with gradient + shadow */
.btn-secondary  /* Secondary button style */
.input-premium  /* Styled input with focus glow */
.card           /* Card with shadow + border */
.badge-success/warning/error/info  /* Status badges */
```

### Component Upgrades

| Component | Changes |
|-----------|---------|
| **ChatInterface** | Gradient background (`from-slate-50 via-white to-blue-50/30`), glass morphism header, wider container (`max-w-4xl`), suggested prompts on welcome screen |
| **ChatInput** | Floating container with focus border glow, animated send button (scale on hover/active), keyboard hints with `<kbd>` styling |
| **MessageBubble** | Gradient user bubbles with drop shadow, AI avatar badge, source section with link icon, typing cursor animation |
| **DocumentDrawer** | Backdrop blur (`backdrop-blur-sm`), slide-in animation, improved header with subtitle, gradient rebuild button |
| **DocumentList** | Staggered entry animation, hover effects with shadow, gradient status badges with icons, reveal-on-hover delete button |
| **DocumentUpload** | Decorative corner elements, scale animation on drag (`scale-[1.02]`), glow during upload, clearer visual hierarchy |
| **SourceCitation** | Gradient badge with border, dark tooltip with code preview styling, smooth transitions |
| **LoadingSpinner** | Cleaner styling with proper border colors |
| **ServerStartingOverlay** | Dual-ring loader (counter-rotating), gradient background, glow effects, hint pill with icon |

### Micro-Interactions Added

1. **Button hover/active states:**
   - Scale transform (`hover:scale-105`, `active:scale-95`)
   - Shadow elevation changes
   - Color transitions

2. **Focus states:**
   - Ring glow effect (`focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500/20`)
   - Border color change

3. **List items:**
   - Staggered fade-in (`animationDelay: ${index * 50}ms`)
   - Group hover effects (child elements react to parent hover)

4. **Transitions:**
   - All interactive elements use `transition-all duration-200`
   - Smooth color, shadow, and transform changes

### Before/After Comparison

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Background | Plain white | Subtle gradient |
| Header | Basic border | Glass morphism + shadow |
| Buttons | Flat colors | Gradients + shadows + transforms |
| Input | Basic border | Floating container + focus glow |
| Messages | Simple rounded | Gradient + shadow + avatar |
| Animations | Minimal | Entrance + hover + loading |
| Scrollbar | Basic gray | Gradient thumb |

### Key UX Improvements

1. **Visual feedback everywhere** - Every click, hover, focus has clear response
2. **Depth hierarchy** - Shadows and gradients create visual layers
3. **Motion design** - Animations guide attention, provide feedback
4. **Accessibility maintained** - Focus states, aria labels, screen reader support

## Bug Fix: Double Focus Ring on Chat Input

### The Problem

When focusing the chat input textarea, two blue rings appeared:
1. The outer container border (intentional - turns blue on focus)
2. An inner rectangle around the textarea itself (unintentional)

This created a visual "double border" effect that looked broken.

### Root Cause

In `globals.css`, we had added a global focus-visible rule for premium focus states:

```css
/* Premium focus states */
*:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid var(--primary-500);
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
```

This `*:focus-visible` selector applies to **all elements**, including the textarea inside the chat input. Even though we had `outline-none` and `focus-visible:outline-none` on the textarea's Tailwind classes, the global CSS rule had higher specificity due to how CSS cascades work.

### Why Tailwind Classes Didn't Override

Tailwind's utility classes like `outline-none` generate:
```css
.outline-none { outline: 2px solid transparent; }
```

But our global rule `*:focus-visible` is applied at render time and can override depending on cascade order and specificity. The browser was applying both styles, with the global one winning.

### The Fix

Added a specific override in `globals.css` for form inputs that typically have custom focus handling via their parent container:

```css
/* Disable focus ring on elements that have custom focus handling via parent */
textarea:focus-visible,
input[type="text"]:focus-visible {
  outline: none;
}
```

This explicitly removes the outline for textareas and text inputs, since they commonly use a parent container pattern for focus indication (like our chat input box that shows focus via border color change on the wrapper div).

### Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Removing the global `*:focus-visible` rule** - Would break focus states on buttons and other elements
2. **Using `!important` in Tailwind** - Anti-pattern, makes debugging harder
3. **More specific Tailwind classes** - Tried `focus:outline-none focus-visible:outline-none`, didn't fully override

### Lesson Learned

When adding global CSS rules with universal selectors (`*`), be careful about unintended effects on form elements. Form inputs often need special handling because:
- They have native browser focus styles
- They're frequently wrapped in containers that handle focus visually
- CSS specificity can be tricky with pseudo-classes like `:focus-visible`

A good pattern: Define global focus styles, then explicitly opt-out specific elements that have custom focus handling.

## UX Enhancement: Auto-Focus Chat Input

### The Change

Added auto-focus behavior to the chat input textarea so users can start typing immediately when visiting the page.

### Implementation

```typescript
// ChatInput.tsx
// Auto-focus on mount
useEffect(() => {
  if (!disabled && textareaRef.current) {
    textareaRef.current.focus();
  }
}, [disabled]);
```

### Why `disabled` in the Dependency Array

The `disabled` prop changes during the app lifecycle:
1. **Initial load**: `disabled=true` (server not ready during cold start)
2. **Server ready**: `disabled=false` (user can type)

By including `disabled` in the dependency array, the textarea automatically focuses when:
- The page first loads (if server is already ready)
- The server becomes ready after cold start (overlay disappears, input becomes enabled)

This ensures users don't have to manually click the input after waiting for the server to start.

### UX Benefit

Standard chat app behavior - users expect to be able to type immediately without clicking. Reduces friction, especially important after a potentially long cold start wait.
