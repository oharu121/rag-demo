## Fixing Pylance Import Warnings in VS Code

### The Problem

When opening the project in VS Code, Pylance shows warnings like:

```
Import "langchain_community.document_loaders" could not be resolvedPylancereportMissingImports
```

This happens because VS Code defaults to a global Python interpreter that doesn't have the project's packages installed.

### Solution: `pyrightconfig.json`

Create a `pyrightconfig.json` in the project root:

```json
{
  "venvPath": ".",
  "venv": ".venv"
}
```

This tells Pyright/Pylance to look for packages in the `.venv` folder, regardless of which interpreter VS Code has selected.

### Why This Works

- `pyrightconfig.json` directly configures **Pyright** (the type checker that Pylance uses)
- It overrides the interpreter selection for **import resolution**
- Works cross-platform (uses relative paths)
- Editor-agnostic (works in VS Code, Neovim, etc.)

### Alternative Considered: `.vscode/settings.json`

```json
{
  "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "${workspaceFolder}/.venv/Scripts/python.exe"
}
```

This approach tells VS Code to auto-select the venv interpreter. However, in testing, `pyrightconfig.json` worked more reliably after a VS Code reload.

### Important Note

The `.venv` folder must exist. Users need to run:

```bash
uv venv .venv
uv sync
```

Then reload VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Developer: Reload Window").

### Summary

| Approach | Scope | Reliability |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `pyrightconfig.json` | Pyright/Pylance only | Works after reload |
| `.vscode/settings.json` | VS Code interpreter | Less reliable in testing |
| Manual interpreter selection | Per-user | Works but annoying |

**Recommendation:** Use `pyrightconfig.json` for projects to ensure anyone who clones won't see import warnings (after setting up `.venv`).
